# JAMANGO - Premium Brand Transformation
> **From e-commerce template to generational boutique brand.**

We have completely overhauled the JAMANGO visual identity to align with the "House of Munagala" heritage. The site now feels like a premium lifestyle destination rather than a transactional marketplace.

---

## 🎨 1. Enhanced Premium Palette
We moved away from generic colors to a curated, nature-inspired system:

- **Primary:** `Mango Gold (#D4A017)` - A muted, rich gold that signifies ripeness and luxury.
- **Background:** `Warm Cream (#F8F4EC)` - Replaces stark white for a softer, editorial feel.
- **Accent:** `Deep Olive (#4A5D23)` - Grounded, trustworthy earth tone.
- **Text:** `Charcoal (#1E1E1E)` - Softer contrast than pure black.

## 🏆 2. Strategic Design Overhauls

### **Hero Section (The Magazine Spread)**
- **Shift:** From centered banner to **Split Asymmetrical Layout**.
- **Left:** Editorial typography on Cream background. "House of Munagala" heritage tag.
- **Right:** Full-height imagery with subtle **slow-zoom animation**.
- **Buttons:** "View Today’s Harvest" (Gold Pill) & "Order via WhatsApp" (Olive Outline).

### **Our Story (The Narrative)**
- **Design:** **55/45 Split** focusing on storytelling.
- **Typography:** Large drop-cap ("J"), elegant serif headings, and a handwritten signature from the Munagala Family.
- **Detail:** Thin gold divider lines for sophistication.

### **Product Collection (Boutique Shelves)**
- **Shift:** From grid cards to **Elegant Product Blocks**.
- **Style:** White cards on Ivory background (`#FBF7F0`).
- **Shape:** Soft **rounded-24px** corners (referenced from Apple/Airbnb design language).
- **details:** Minimal olive leaf icons instead of loud badges.

### **Trust & Process (Minimalism)**
- **Trust:** 3-Column layout with **large faint gold numbers (01, 02, 03)** in the background.
- **Delivery:** Reduced clutter. 4 minimal badges. "Handled With Care."
- **How It Works:** Clean, white cards with numbered steps.

### **Header & Footer (The Frame)**
- **Header:** Warm cream blur effect. **Gold underline hover** animation.
- **Footer:** Deep Warm Brown (`#2B1F1F`) foundation. "Seasonal. Limited. Fresh." tagline.

## 👨‍💻 Technical Upgrades
- **Global CSS Variables:** Full implementation of the new HSL color system in `index.css`.
- **Border Radius:** Standardized to **24px (`1.5rem`)** for a cohesive soft feel.
- **Typography:** Enforced `Playfair Display` (Serif) for headings and `DM Sans` (Sans) for body.
- **Performance:** Optimized animations (transform/opacity only) for 60fps luxury feel.

---

## 🚀 Post-Redesign Checklist
1. **Typography:** Ensure `Playfair Display` and `DM Sans` are loaded in your `index.html` to fully realize the editorial look.
2. **Photography:** The new cream background requires warm-toned, high-quality images. Ensure `hero-mangoes.jpg` and `orchard.jpg` are premium grade.
3. **Logo:** The new header expects a clean logo asset.

The site is now ready for the "Seasonal Drop". 🍷🥭
